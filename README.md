# <p align="center"> 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄 </p>

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 project repository! This project is part of my personal journey in enhancing my programming skills and solving fun, holiday-themed coding puzzles. 

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual event that provides a series of programming puzzles over the month of December. Each day, a new puzzle is released, offering a unique and interesting challenge that ranges from easy to difficult. It's a great way for programmers of all levels to have fun while practicing their coding skills.

For more information about Advent of Code, including how to participate, please visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles. Each folder is organized by day and contains:

- A Problem Description: Outlines the daily puzzle and its requirements.
- My Solution: Includes executable code solving the day's puzzle.
- Notes and Commentary: Any thoughts or explanations of the approach I used.

## Language and Tools 🧑‍💻

For this project, I'm using C++, along with any supporting libraries or tools that I find helpful. This is a learning experience, so you'll notice a variety of techniques and approaches as I work through the puzzles. Heck, you might even notice me switch up programming languages here and there. 

## Why Participate in Advent of Code?

- **To Learn**: Enhance your coding skills by solving diverse and interesting problems.
- **To Share**: Collaborate and discuss different approaches with a community of like-minded individuals.
- **To Enjoy**: Experience the joy of solving puzzles and being part of an engaging programming community.
